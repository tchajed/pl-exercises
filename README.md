# Programming Language Exercises

Programs to implement for learning new programming languages. Goal is to give a narrow and precise spec such that implementing each one takes about a day (less in a familiar language). Each program should be standalone and work with input and output that can be tested from a generic test harness (in addition to any in-language tests). Behavior and algorithms should be entirely specified.
